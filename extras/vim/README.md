# Vim Syntax Highlighting for L3

Dead simple regex-based syntax highlighting for L3 files. It's not perfect by
any means and sometimes highlighting incorrect things, but it's miles better
than nothing at all.

## Installation

Copy the context of this folder into `~/.vim`, such that there is
`~/.vim/syntax/lang3.vim` and `~/.vim/ftdetect/lang3.vim`.
